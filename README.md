## 🔍 TL;DR

**BlockWatch AI** is a decentralized, AI-powered security system for Web3 ecosystems. It continuously scans smart contract activity and user transactions across multiple blockchains, detects threats using machine learning and anomaly detection, and optionally triggers on-chain responses through DAO-based governance.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- 🚨 **Real-Time Blockchain Surveillance**: Continuously monitors smart contract creations, token movements, and wallet interactions.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Detection Engine**: Uses NLP and anomaly detection to identify threats like honeypots, flash loan exploits, rugpulls, and wallet drainers.
- 🧾 **Threat Scoring System**: Every interaction or contract gets scored and stored — queryable via API or UI.
- 📊 **User Interface & API**: Interactive dashboard with search, monitoring tools, and integration support for wallets/dApps.
- ⛓️ **On-chain Threat Registry**: Optional DAO-based governance to validate or remove flagged entities, enabling real-time threat mitigation.
